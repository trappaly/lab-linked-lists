# Mini-Project 8 : Linked Lists Revisited
================
Due: Wednesday Aprtil 17th, 2024

Acknowledgements: The online resources I used for this project are the iterator reading, the doubly linked list lab, Eboard 31, and the JavaDoc for the Array List class and Iterator interface. I discussed ideas about the project with classmate Medhashree Adhikari. I got help from the tutors: Jayson, Boston, Audrey. I also got help from Professor Rebelskey.

Short Description: This project implements a circular doubly linked list using a dummy node to simplify the code. 
The dummy node simplifies the code because it allows us not have to check for edge cases about whether an element is null or not. 
Since the dummy node exists, the value will never be null. The iterators in the project are used to call the different function. If one iterator makes a change to the list, then the other iterators are invalidated. 

Instructions for Running the Program: Run the SCDLLExpt.java file to see if the function are performing their expected behavior.

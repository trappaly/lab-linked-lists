# Mini-Project 8 : Linked Lists Revisited
================
Due: Wednesday Aprtil 17th, 2024

Acknowledgements: The online resources I used for this project are the iterator reading, the doubly linked list lab, Eboard 31, and the JavaDoc for the Array List class and Iterator interface. I discussed ideas about the project with classmates Medhashree Adhikari, Connor Heagy, 
Trung Le, and Vivien Yan. I got help from the tutors: Jayson, Boston, Audrey, and Diogo. I also got help from Professor Rebelskey. 

Short Description: This project implements a circular doubly linked list using a dummy node to simplify the code. 
The dummy node simplifies the code because it allows us not have to check for edge cases. For example in the add method, before there were three checks, but now there are no checks because we don't have to look at the empty cases. In the remove method it was similar where there were more than two cases before, but now there are only two cases.  The iterators in the project are used to call the different function. If one iterator makes a change to the list, then the other iterators will be invalidated. 

Instructions for Running the Program: Run the SCDLLExpt.java file to see if the experiments called are performing their expected behavior.
